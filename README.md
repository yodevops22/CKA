If you want to become a Certified Kubernetes Administrator, or you want to become an EXPERT in Kubernetes, learn
Kubernetes from scratch and understand everything, this repo is a good choice.

In this repo, you'll be prepared to pass the exam. You'll also learn more about Kubernetes concepts that are not in the
exam, such as `Kubernetes on AWS (EKS)`, `Operators`, `Helm`, `Microservices`, `Prometheus`, and most
importantly, `install and set up a K8s cluster` from scratch (In the exam, you won't have to install a cluster, but
knowing how to do it gives you a **huge advantage!**)

With this repo and other sources I mentioned below, you'll prepare to pass the exam and be confident about your
Kubernetes knowledge!

Have Fun!

* Comprehensive
* Hands-On Demos
* Zero-To-Expert
